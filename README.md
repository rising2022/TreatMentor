# TreatMentor

This project uses novel techniques of Machine learning and IR techniques to detect diseases based on symptoms and provide more details about the top fetched diseases including treatment recommendation.

The model which performed best was _DT (Decision Tree) & KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) with an accuracy of 91.29% and LR (Logistic Regression) model with cross validation accuracy of 89.1%._

The system can be used by a person with restricted medical knowledge as well with ease and can come handy in early disease detection and diagnosis. It can also benefit users that are reluctant to visit hospitals on the onset of minor symptoms. This will provide them with a basic idea of the severity of the disease.
